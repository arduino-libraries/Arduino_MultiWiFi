# MultiWiFi

[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/alranel/MultiWiFi)](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360018434279-I-have-used-Arduino-for-my-project-do-I-need-to-release-my-source-code-)

This Arduino library provides a wrapper around the WiFi library to allow you to configure multiple networks (SSID/passphrase combinations) within your sketch, and connect to the first available one.

This functionality is already available in the ESP32 core, but this library provides a platform-independent implementation that works with any core.

> See the [library home page](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/multiwifi/) and the [examples](examples/) for more information about this library and its usage.

## Usage

```arduino
void setup() {
    MultiWiFi multi;
    multi.add("myssid", "mypassphrase");
    multi.add("myssid_2", "mypassphrase_2");
    
    if (multi.run() == WL_CONNECTED) {
        Serial.print("Successfully connected to network: ");
        Serial.println(WiFi.SSID());
    } else {
        Serial.println("Failed to connect to a WiFi network");
    }
}
```
